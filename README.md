This program is designed to analyze and generate statistics from messenger data. Here's a brief summary of the statistics it calculates:

2. **Messages Count:**
   - It calculates the total number of messages for each chat.

4. **Participant Count:**
   - It counts the number of messages sent by each participant in a given chat.

5. **Messages by Time:**
   - It groups messages by time (daily interval) and returns the count of messages for each time interval.

6. **Messages by Time by Sender:**
   - Similar to the previous one, but it also distinguishes messages by sender.

8. **Reaction Matrix:**
   - It generates a matrix showing how often participants reacted to each other's messages.

9. **Reaction Counts by Participant:**
   - It provides the count of each reaction for each participant, sorted by frequency.

Please note that the program uses the pandas library for data manipulation and assumes the existence of a `get_messenger_json` function in a module named `loader`.
